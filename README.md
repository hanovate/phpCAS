phpCAS for Laravel
==================

This is a fork of apereo/phpCAS to make it more compatible with Laravel framework.
This is a dependency of the [hanovate/cas](https://github.com/hanovate/cas) package.

phpCAS is an authentication library that allows PHP applications to easily authenticate
users via a Central Authentication Service (CAS) server.  This has been updated to
utilize Laravel's session management methods instead of native PHP's $_SESSION, $_SERVER,
$_POST, and $_GET variables.

Checked with Laravel 8.18.1 as of 2020-12-10
Checked with Laravel 7.6.0 as of 2020-04-14
